# DeepRL_Navigation_Banana_Collector
## Introduction
The project is the first one of the three projects required for graduating [Udacity's Deep Reinforcement Learning Nano Degree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893). The base code for implementation is borowwed from the [Udacity's implementation of Deep Q Networks](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/blob/master/dqn/exercise/Deep_Q_Network.ipynb), which i have modified to add Double Q and Dueling Networks.
